# SIADS 697 Capstone Project - Team Breakfast Analytica - Kristina Garber, Benjamin Bartek, Jono O'Dowd

Kristina Garber, Benjamin Bartek & Jono O'Dowd formed a team called TEAM BREAKFAST ANALYTICA to create a Seattle Airbnb Advisory Dashboard for our University of Michigan SIADS 697 Capstone class project. 
We utilized various data science techniques and tools to accomplish our goals. We started with qualitative research to determine all the possibilities related to available data sets and potential questions 
that might be helpful to those using our dashboard. Our resulting research inspired us to build an advisory dashboard for future Seattle Airbnb hosts and customers. For hosts, it is a tool to determine 
best location to startup an Airbnb in Seattle. For customers, it is a tool to determine best location to stay at an Airbnb in Seattle. The data sets would be a combination of Airbnb, crime, recreational, 
and nearby shopping data. The analyzed data would give guidance on picking the best area to startup an Airbnb based on good profit margins, lower crime, proximity to nearby recreational activities and shopping. 
All of our gathered data went through rigorous cleansing, wrangling and standardization. The data sets were joined as needed and visual exploration was done to help understand how it should be structured for the 
model phase. Both unsupervised and supervised learning models were used. A real insightful unsupervised model, K-Means Clustering was used to discover and segment neighborhoods according to clusters with similar 
patterns. For example, this clustering model segmented neighborhoods into clusters of lowest crime, medium crime, high crime, and highest crime. The clustering also helped to determine neighborhood clusters with 
the greatest amount of choices of nearby recreational activities and shopping and those neighborhoods where pricing could be advantageous to those starting up an Airbnb and likewise potential customers looking for 
the best deal. Supervised models such as linear regression and Meta's Prophet provided insight of continuous variables and forecasting. CoCalc was our centralized 
collaboration tool. It provided a repository and workspace to collaborate using Jupyter Notebooks to interact with the data in our repository and import all the necessary python libraries and models to accomplish 
our goals of preparing and analyzing the data to fit into our final dashboard product. We tried many different dashboard tools such as Dash, Streamlit and Panel but finally decided on Tableau for four reasons. 
First, it's free to students for up to a year. Second, it was extremely user friendly in working with our model outputs. Third, it creates beautiful dashboards, and last but certainly not least, Tableau is 
predominantly used in various workplaces; job opportunities are abundant for those with Tableau experience. It will help each team member later in the interviewing process for a data science related job.
